# Email-Classification (Spam/Ham)

Welcome to one of my many senior data science projects where I use analysis, data engineering, and machine learning to solve a real-world problem.

Ever wonder how your email provider knows which emails are potentially junkmail or not?! Well, I don't know exactly how they do it but I would put my money on the fact they use some sort of classification technique. That's exactly what I do in this project - engineer features that can help a classifier (model) infer whether an email is junk mail or real mail.

Scroll to the bottom under the header of Exploratory Data Anlysis (EDA) to see how I explored email data to engineer features that successfully classified emails with 94% accuracy!
